# revision: A LaTeX package to suggest editions and add comments.

This package defines 2 commands:

1. `\newrevisor{name}{color-for-insert}[color-for-delete]` where the first
   argument is the name of the revisor, second argument is color for additions
   and third optional argument is color for deletions. If the third argument is
   missing, the second argument is used for both additions and deletions.  See
   colornames in https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors
   
  This command creates two new commands:
  
  * Lowercase `\name{text-to-delete}{text-to-insert}` for suggesting changes.
  
  * Uppercase `\NAME{text}` for adding comments.
  
2. `\hiderevisor{name}` Disables the corresponding commands generated by
   `\newrevisor{name}`, that is, removes comments and suggested deletions and
   shows suggested additions without coloring them.

Example:

```latex
\newrevisor{manuel}{violet!75} \hiderevisor{manuel}
% Creates lowercase \manuel{}{} and uppercase \MANUEL{}
```

Pull requests are welcome.
